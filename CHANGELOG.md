- Added buildspec.yaml file for CI/CD pipeline [#81]
- Added graphql file structure and client creation. [#36]

### Updates
- Updated lib/graphql/client.ts with adding an errorLink to the client instance, and intercepting specific error types or codes to handle them differently if we want.[#29]
- Updated lib/graphql/server/queries/dmpDataQueries.ts to 1) Map the error code to a user friendly message using a hash like utils/userFriendlyErrorMessage, log the error to the new utils/logger.ts, and throw an error that will be caught by the "try-catch" in the client- or server-side component. logger.ts can be used directly in client- and server-components as well.[#29]
- Updated dmps/[...slug]/page.tsx to throw the returned error in the 'try-catch'[#29]
- Installed pino and @elastic/ecs-pino-format to output formatted logs[#29]
- Added app/not-found.tsx to handle 404 errors[#29]
- Added app/error.tsx to handle server-side errors. Client components will most likely display returned errors in the page using useState().[#29]
